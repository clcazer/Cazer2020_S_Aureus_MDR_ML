# this script contains functions to clean MIC data and prepare it for rule or set mining
# 
# requires: .csv of breakpoints (interpretive criteria). AM names in csv must be same as AM names in MIC data. The breakpoint is the only other column required. It should be the non-susceptible breakpoint such that bacteria are NS if they are > breakpoint. Therefore, the breakpoint value is the highest MIC for susceptible bacteria. 
# 
# Abbreviations: 
#   MIC: Minimum inhibitory concentration
# bp: breakpoint, i.e. interpretive criteria for MIC value
# S: susceptible
# NS: non-susceptible (may be used interchangeably with resistant/R)
# AM: antimicrobial
